/*
 * The stuff that uses the enum was planned for autonomous mode to be able to abstractly define where the wrist should move.
 * However, it is not used at all in teleop mode, and so should be placed into its own command. This command should only
 * do the mapping between the operator console potentiometer and the wrist potentiometer - that is, this command should move the wrist
 * to a desired angle instead of to an enumerated position. It should be set as the default command for the subsystem and refactored to
 * "Wrist Controller"
 * 
 * Another concern is that the enum will not work as well as we'd like. The code that moves the wrist to an angle should be generated first,
 * then we can simply run the "MoveWristToAngle" function from the autonomous command and pass it the angle we need. Different position variales
 * can be secified to achieve this result.
